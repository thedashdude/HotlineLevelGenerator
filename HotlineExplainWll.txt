level0.wll handles walls.
Each entry in level0.wll has no seperator, just a consistant number of lines.
The format of each entry is:
<number>
<x>
<y>
<number 2>
<other>

What <other> does is unknown, but it apears to always be 0.
<number> and <number 2> handle the type of wall, but I dont have all possible values recorded

<num>
	8 = vertical basic wall 
	7 = horizontal basic wall
	682 = vertical glass
	683 = horizontal glass

<x>
	x in pixels

<y>
	y in pixels

<num2>
	63 = vertical basic wall
	62 = horizontal basic wall
	1996 = vertical glass
	1997 = horizontal glass

<other>
	just 0

Example:
For a vertical basic wall at (32,128):
8

128
63
0
